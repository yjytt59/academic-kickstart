In order to understand the growth and evolution of city in Switzerland from spatial and temporal aspects, this work identifies natural cities from nighttime light data and streets. Natural city refers to spatially clustered geographic events, such as human settlements or activities. It provides a powerful insight to analyze the growth of the real city. Nighttime light data record lights emitted from human settlements at night on the earthâ€™s surface. This work uses DMSP-OLS Nighttime light data to extract natural cities from 1992 to 2013. The street is one of the most important factors to reflect human activities. Hence, natural cities are also extracted from street data to understand the structure of cities. Both of these data have a heavy-tailed distribution, which includes power laws as well as lognormal and exponential distributions. The head/tail breaks is a classification method to find the hierarchy of data with a heavytailed distribution. This work uses head/tail breaks classification to extract natural cities of Switzerland. At last, the power law distribution of all the natural cities was detected at the country level.
