abstract = "Critical infrastructures are providing flows of services, the disruption of which are seriously affect- ing society’s functioning and well-being. There is an emerging trend of interdependencies within and between infrastructure systems becoming more coupled, making them prone to ‘domino ef- fects’. While interdependencies within an infrastructure system may be represented as flows of networks, the representation of interdependencies between systems has been a challenge. Until now, most of the existing works have not modelled spatial interdependencies. This project aims to clearly define spatial interdependencies of critical infrastructures or systems and build the framework for knowledge of infrastructures and their interdependencies. Based on this framework, a tool will be developed to represent interdependencies of different systems. Once a formal consistent representation exists, ontology-driven information systems (ODIS) provide interfaces to answer what-if questions (query languages), to automate or semi-automate inferential reasoning. This ODIS can be used to connect to the existing geospatial database and support different applications (e.g. urban planning, spatial analysis)."
