abstract = "A landform is a subjective geomorphic feature such as a mountain or a valley. On a topographic map, landforms are not explicitly portrayed but perceived by the readers from the organization of cartographic elements such as contours and spot heights. Achieving automatic landform recognition is a difficult task because defini- tions are usually qualitative and vague. However, in an application such as nautical chart construction, undersea features are selected and portrayed according to their relevance to navigation. Hence recognizing undersea features from sets of sound- ings and isobaths would help to select significant soundings and isobaths and to automate the generalization process. For that purpose, we propose a framework that helps to bridge the gap between the verbal definition of features and their quantitative representation on the chart. On one side, we define an application on- tology where feature descriptions are structured according to formal concepts and on the other side, we define a representation ontology which describes the geomet- rical elements and properties used to model features on the chart. The connection between the two ontologies is performed by semantic mediators where qualitative concepts are associated with quantitative properties applied to features and mea- sured from soundings and isobaths. The model has been implemented and applied to a bathymetric dataset. Results of this case study are then presented, discussing the reliability of the classification for the description of undersea features."
