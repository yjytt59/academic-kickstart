# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The conference is co-organized by Institute of Space and Earth Information Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, National Remote Sensing Center of China and The International Association of Chinese Professionals in Geographic Information Sciences (CPGIS). This presentation aims at introducing an ontology of the nautical chart generalisation process that will be at the root of a model oriented generalisation process. This ontology includes both a top-level ontology of spatial relationships and a domain ontology of geographical objects of the submarine relief."
